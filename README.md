# Advent of Code 2024

This is the first and only run through AoC that I will partake in. 
After completing the majority of the problems contained in this year's challenge and having my time thoroughly wasted on more than one occasion, I don't really ever want to see one of these things again and think the author should really reconsider themselves as a whole. 

Here's why: 

## Not of Spirit Nor Mind
Advent calendars are supposed to have small gifts. Things to get you into the spirit of the holiday. 
Puzzles that take hours upon hours to code with easy to understand yet painfully obtuse algorithms are not small nor do they actually get you into the spirit of the holiday. 
They just waste time that you could be spending with your family or doing actual holiday things. 

### But that's like your opinion man

Yeah, it is. Mine just happens to be right. 
Get used to it or gtfo. 
Know why I can have that attitude? 
Because I, Me, Myself, whatever word you want to use, am the only authority on my own personal time. 
People that waste my time are wrong. Full stop. 
I only have oh-so-many hours of my life before I expire and wasting it over a puzzle that was unmindfully designed to waste time is not only fucking stupid, it's disrespectful. 

### That's a real childish take

Possibly. But then again, I have more free time than you by recognizing when someone or something is intentionally trying to waste my time.
I cut that shit out of my life. You should try it some time instead of wasting your life soullessly and with nothing to show for it.

## Disrespectful with Regards to People's Time
When you have challenges that are reported as taking over 8 hours to figure out, it's a sign - clear and simple - that you are not keeping your participants and their time in mind. 
The Xmas holiday is meant to be spent with friends/family and unless you are a sociopath, spending 8 hours on a problem that should have been 30~60 minutes tops is not only inaccurate to what Advent is about, it's just fucking rude and wasteful. 
You can disagree all you want and I could agree with you, but then two of us would be dumb AND wrong. 

### Free puzzle is free, stop complaining
No. Not when it was advertised using a term that means one thing while being a completely different thing. 
So no, I won't stop complaining. 
I don't appreciate people wasting my time. 
AoC is a waste of time in that it presents you with non-world problems in obtuse ways with the design intent of an obstinant musk-child.
As opposed to fun and SMALL, you know... like Advent chocolates... 
Again, you can disagree all you want. You'll still be wrong and I'll still think you're an idiot.

The end.
